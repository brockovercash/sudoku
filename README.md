# sudoku
Used to give hints to solve sudoku puzzles and demonstrate sudoku solving techniques

## Instructions
 - Clone and open sudoku.py  
 - Input your puzzle in the puzzle placeholder  
 - Choose your level of hint by commenting out the print methods below the input  
 - Run ```python3 sudoku.py```
    - I like to run ```python3 sudoku.py > hints.txt``` and open that file in an editor that handles the width of the hint tables.
